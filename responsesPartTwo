A. Names: Nirman Dave, Mei Zhou, Alina Dao
Description: use momentum optimization with a momentum of 0.9, learning rate 0.001
Summary of Results:
Number of epochs to reach a validation accuracy of 0.4: Epoch 9
Validation accuracy after 100 epochs: 0.64432889
Note: We ran the program to completion at 1000 Epoches. We found out that the validation accuracy did not ever reach 0.66. At around 150 epoches, it started to fluctuate between 0.65 and 0.648/0.649.
