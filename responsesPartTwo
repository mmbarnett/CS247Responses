modification you made (what's on the assignment is fine) and the summary results:

A. Names: Nirman Dave, Mei Zhou, Alina Dao
Description: use momentum optimization with a momentum of 0.9, learning rate 0.001
Summary of Results:
Number of epochs to reach a validation accuracy of 0.4: Epoch 9
Validation accuracy after 100 epochs: 0.64432889
Note: We ran the program to completion at 1000 Epoches. We found out that the validation accuracy did not ever reach 0.66. At around 150 epoches, it started to fluctuate between 0.65 and 0.648/0.649.  

D. Names: Ian Nanez, Hutomo Limanto, Obi Daniel Ezeogu
Description: use momentum optimization with a momentum of 0.5, learning rate 0.001
Summary Results:
Number of epochs to reach a validation accuracy of 0.4: Epoch 20
Validation accuracy after 100 epochs (batch_size = 100): 0.59751952

E. Names: Evelyn Ting, Zach Bessette, Saharsha Karki
Description: use momentum optimization with a momentum of 0.5, learning rate 0.01
Summary of Results:
Number of epochs to reach a validation accuracy of 0.4: Epoch 3
Validation accuracy after 100 epochs (batch_size = 100): 0.664233
Note:  Zach and Saharsha’s programs got stuck with the original seed.  Evelyn’s never did.  Also, Evelyn’s validation accuracy was higher than Zach and Saharsha’s for each epoch for each run (even though we had the same code).

G. Names: Mahesh Dhulipala, Ian McClaugherty, Bishesh Yadav
Description: Keep percentage to 0.5, fully connected hidden layer of 256
Summary Results:

Validation accuracy after 100 epochs (batch_size = 100): 0.62292457

R. Names: Megan Root, Harrison Marick, Dorit Song
Description: Changed dropout keep_prob to 0.8 and made stride length of one max pool layer 1

T. Names: Tiffany Kha, Azka Javaid, Jordan Browning 
Description: add another convu/relu/maxpool layer but keep input to fully connected layer at 3x3 compare to tf.nn.avg_pool
Summary results:
Number of epochs to reach a validation accuracy of 0.4: Epoch 2 (previously with max pool Epoch 8)
Validation accuracy after 100 epochs (batch_size = 100): 0.70003998 [previously with maxpool .5663]

V. Names: Evan Wolf, Brendan Routh, Gab Conclaves
Description: add a second fully connected layer of size 256
Summary results:
Number of epochs to reach a validation accuracy of 0.4: 25
Validation accuracy after 100 epochs (batch_size = 100): 0.658532

X. Names: Ehsan Mojahedi, Jack Muller, Olivia Pinney
Description: "Use a learning rate that increases if something is going well dropping and decreases if going badly."
Summary of Results:
Number of epochs to reach a validation accuracy of 0.4: Epoch 6
Validation accuracy after 100 epochs: 0.10482097
Note: Our validation and test accuracy dropped sharply at epoch 88. This issue could be avoided by implementing
more complex logic to change the learning rate. Improved logic would only increase or decrease the learning
rate if there is a significant change in loss (avg_cost) between epochs. 

Y. Names: Michael Barnett, Miriam De La Riva Ovalle, Denison Marsland-Rello
Description: “use a learning rate that gradually decreases (make the learning rate a placeholder so it can change).
Summary of results:
Number of epochs to reach a validation accuracy of 0.4: Epoch 231
Validation accuracy after 100 epochs: 0.35007
